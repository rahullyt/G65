Real-time Based Facial Recognition System

Human face is the significant characteristic to identify a person. Everyone has their
own unique face even for twins. Thus, a face recognition and identification are required to
distinguish each other. A face recognition system is the verification system to find a personâ€™s
identity through biometric method. Face recognition has become a popular method nowadays in
many applications such as phone unlock system, criminal identification and even home security
system. This system is more secure as it does not need any dependencies such as key and card
but only facial image is needed. Generally, human recognition system involves 2 phases which
are face detection and face identification. This paper describes the concept on how to design and
develop a face recognition system through deep learning using OpenCV in python. Deep learning
is an approach to perform the face recognition and seems to be an adequate method to carry out
face recognition due to its high accuracy. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the
accuracy of the proposed face recognition system.
